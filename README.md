# Simple Slime Game

This repository contains the source code for a simple console-based slime game, developed in C#. The game is currently in its initial phase of development.

## Gameplay (Planned)

The vision for this game is a simple text-based adventure where the player controls a slime. The core mechanics will include:

*   Exploring a simple world
*   Encountering and interacting with different objects
*   Growing the slime by consuming items

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, please follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This project requires the .NET 8 SDK to be installed on your machine. You can download it from the official .NET website.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/simple-slime-game.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd simple-slime-game
    ```

### Running the game

Once you are in the project's root directory, you can run the application using the following command:

```sh
dotnet run
```

This will execute the `Program.cs` file, which is the entry point of our application.

## Game Logic

The core game logic is located in the `Program.cs` file. Currently, the game is in a pre-alpha state and the `Program.cs` file only prints a "Hello, World!" message to the console.

As the project develops, this file will be updated to include the main game loop, player input handling, and the overall game flow.
